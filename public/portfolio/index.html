<h3 id="enterprise-saas-processes--platform-capabilities-for-regulated-industries">Enterprise SaaS Processes &amp; Platform Capabilities for Regulated Industries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#enterprise-saas-processes--platform-capabilities-for-regulated-industries">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
SSO Integration (OIDC, SAML), RBAC, Custom Roles, Proxy Collector Support. Rewritten all security procedures and controls for SOC II and related audit requirements, implemented a new customer trust portal for questionnaire automation. Included in the changes supporting this was a series of changes to the WAF implementation to block known bad vectors and aligning with standards like OWASP top 10 and product improvements giving users more control over their authentication configuration. These platform improvements and process improvements aided Moogsoft&rsquo;s push into the highly regulated financial sector which supported record quarters back to back in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
For the first time in company history a SOC audit came back with zero material findings after a full rewrite of security procedures, protocols and standards was completed. This drastically increased customer confidence in the product and platform and unblocked several pending deals to move forward totaling ~1.5 MM in recurring revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong><br>
AWS EKS, AWS OpenSearch, AWS Aurora MySQL, Cloudflare DNS, Workers, CDN &amp; WAF, Java, Vue.js, Kafka, Mongodb, Thanos, Auth0, Ambassador EDGE Stack</p>

<h3 id="product-features-for-incident-operators">Product Features for Incident Operators<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#product-features-for-incident-operators">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
Led a cross-functional effort to gather the requirements, design and complete the implementation for several features that when combined created a robust incident management capability within the product.</p>
<ul>
<li>A situation room aiding operators in managing ongoing incidents with features such as:
<ul>
<li>A chat capability aligned with incidents allowing for general discussion around an incident but also the ability to flag which comments were part of the resolving steps for an incident, allowing for reuse of this knowledge in future incidents.</li>
<li>Automatically detecting similar incidents so that they can be shown along with their resolving steps.</li>
<li>A timeline showing how alerts unfolded over time and allowing for forensics during and after incidents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
These features drove strong sales conversion in Q2 and Q3 where we remained above forecast by 15% across both quarters.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong><br>
Quarkus Java, Vue, Aurora MySQL</p>
<p><strong>Visuals:</strong><br>

<h3 id="cloud-cost-savings-and-re-architecture">Cloud Cost Savings and Re-Architecture<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cloud-cost-savings-and-re-architecture">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
Led a refactor with my architect to make our services multitenant aware allowing for a significant reduction in the footprint of the infrastructure required to operate them. We also consolidated several similar services and began to adopt a modules not services approach. This significantly reduced the connection overhead on shared components such as Mongodb and Kafka as well, allowing for further right sizing. Finally, we negotiated an ELA with AWS, purchased reserved instances and moved to ephemeral compute for services capable of operating in this way reliably.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
This led to a 64% cost reduction to operate a single customer. The reuse of infrastructure with multitenant aware services allowed us to deploy far fewer pods and run much leaner clusters. With connections being our primary bottleneck for scaling shared components like Mongo, Kafka and AWS Aurora the reduction in pod count paid dividends and allowed us to shrink these clusters to see further savings.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong><br>
CloudHealth, Kubecost, AWS Cost Explorer, Excel&hellip;. lots of Excel</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="time-series-v2">Time Series v2<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#time-series-v2">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
Migrated the product&rsquo;s timeseries data store from Mongodb to <a href="https://thanos.io/">Thanos</a> (Highly available Prometheus setup with long term storage capabilities). Reimagined anomaly detection configuration to enable simple but deep alerting that relied on PromQL. Redesigned query UI to allow for faceted search that generated PromQL using open source <a href="https://promlens.com/">PromLens</a> (the query builder for PromQL).</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
The new capability allowed customers to fine tune anomaly detection with a dynamic metric policy that leveraged PromQL syntax. This lessened the configuration burden for customers to maintain their alerts. This also unblocked the Grafana integration that was on hold.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong><br>
Thanos, MongoDB, PromLens, Prometheus-Proxy</p>

<h3 id="grafana-infinity-datasource-for-moogsoft">Grafana Infinity Datasource for Moogsoft<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#grafana-infinity-datasource-for-moogsoft">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
Assisted Grafana and a mutual client with developing an <a href="https://sriramajeyam.com/grafana-infinity-datasource/">Infinity datasource</a> integration for Moogsoft&rsquo;s existing REST APIs. This allowed for real time updates in Grafana without any changes in the Moogsoft API or code base.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
Several clients were able to reuse the new integration and solve a long standing feature request for the new SaaS product.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong><br>
Grafana, Infinity data source plugin, REST APIs</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>VP of Engineering</strong></p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 year</p>
<p><strong>Brief Description:</strong><br>
Oversaw all aspects of engineering with the exception of the data science teams. This included both product lines; on premise and SaaS.</p>
<p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong><br>
During this time, we reorganized engineering and other parts of the business to focus on the SaaS product. Both the product and team were adding more SaaS features and skillsets respectively. This transition alone was an achievement as we successfully reorganized the business around the SaaS product and engineering started to gain momentum in the new model.</p>
<p><strong>Projects:</strong></p>
<h3 id="provisioning-middleware">Provisioning Middleware<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#provisioning-middleware">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
An integration between a custom built provisioning pipeline, Sales Ops tooling and integration with Marketing forms to provide an end-to-end automated provisioning pipeline and automatically reaped expired trials to keep cloud costs efficient.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
Saw a significant improvement in the trial lifecycle being automated to keep costs down. Estimates were ~10% savings on our cloud spend for the product line.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong><br>
Stripe, Salesforce, AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, Python, JavaScript, Stripe, Sendgrid, Vue.js, dbt, Marketo</p>

<h3 id="rust-language-selection-for-collector">Rust Language Selection for Collector<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rust-language-selection-for-collector">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
The initial prototype observability agent for the SaaS product was written in Java and carried a heavy footprint when compared competitively against similar agents in the market. Product wanted to see a lighter weight agent created to make us more competitive. We explored, built prototypes and implemented an initial version in Rust. Later, this was migrated to leverage <a href="https://vector.dev/">Vector.dev</a>, a Rust-based telemetry pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
Aligning with Rust and selecting Vector as the framework allowed us to deliver numerous capabilities for customers and provided them with a reliable platform we were building on. This allowed customers to take on more complex integrations and deployment models to meet their needs for a local installation of our agent.</p>

<h3 id="network-telemetry-improvements--tooling-consolidation">Network Telemetry Improvements &amp; Tooling Consolidation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#network-telemetry-improvements--tooling-consolidation">#</a></h3>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
In collaboration with the network engineering, storage engineering, and architecture teams, GoDaddy underwent a strategic overhaul of network tools and telemetry to prepare for SDN and modernize the network stack. My team and I were responsible for the observability/telemetry portion of this initiative.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sevone:</strong> Collected SNMP data with SevOne and created a topology based on this data, which was then fed to Moogsoft to aid correlation of network outages. SevOne replaced Zabbix, Nagios, and CA Spectrum tools.</li>
<li><strong>Kentik:</strong> Collected sFlow and NetFlow data from network and security devices distributed across the company.</li>
<li><strong>Elastalert:</strong> Designed, built, and deployed an Elasticsearch cluster to analyze syslog data for network devices, enabling more intelligent alerts.</li>
<li><strong>Moogsoft:</strong> Correlated events using a vertex entropy method that relied on underlying topology data to understand node fragility and potential impact.</li>
<li><strong>ServiceNow:</strong> Integrated device records, metadata, and provisioning of devices into other monitoring applications using a custom development integration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced network team overhead and decreased MTTR by 40%.</li>
<li>Provided near real-time topology for operators, aiding in accurate diagnosis of incidents.</li>
<li>Improved automated mitigation times from ~15 minutes to sub-minute once a bad actor was detected.</li>
</ul>
