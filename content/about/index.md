    <p>I'm an engineering executive with a proven track record in turning clever ideas into scalable, production-grade systems. My experience spans SRE, product management, and full-stack engineering, having led teams at GoDaddy, Moogsoft, and Vultr. I've built robust observability frameworks that drive actionable insights while also architecting and operating backend microservices using technologies like Quarkus.</p>
    <p>Notably, I led a critical migration from a legacy Java agent to a high-performance Rust-based solution, significantly enhancing performance and reducing system footprint. In essence, I combine hands-on technical expertise with strategic leadership to drive products from conception to large-scale operation.</p>

## My Journey

Starting my career early career at IBM I learned the rigors of an FDA regulated helpdesk by working on the Azstrazeneca account for 2 years while completing my associates degree at an upstate New York community college. Leaving IBM I found my way to Arizona and joined GoDaddy, I helped modernize monitoring systems cutting detection and resolution times while establishing a culture of continuous improvement. After 12 years at GoDaddy I left to get outside my comfort zone at Moogsoft. I transformed our platform with AI-powered incident management tools that fueled multi-million ARR growth and streamlined operations for enterprise clients. More recently, at Vultr, I spearheaded initiatives that integrated advanced AI/ML techniques into both backend and observability systems, optimizing cloud performance and reducing costs on a global scale.

## Philosophy & Vision

For me, leadership means bridging the gap between high-level product strategy and hands-on technical execution. I believe the best outcomes are achieved by building engineering cultures centered around empowerment, measuring iterative change towards a clear goal, and by building inclusive and diverse teams. I'm data driven in my application of observability platforms, crafting efficient microservices, or mentoring teams to excel in fast-paced environments by focusing on impact and applying light weight processes. My guiding principle is simple: **"Do what you say you're going to do, even when it's inconvenient."** which allows me to build trust within and amongst my teams.
