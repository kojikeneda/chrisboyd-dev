# About Me

I’m an engineering executive passionate about turning operational data into actionable insights that drive innovation, reliability, and growth. With a career that spans leadership roles at GoDaddy, Moogsoft, and Vultr, I’ve witnessed firsthand how a robust observability strategy not only enhances system performance but also empowers the teams behind it.

## My Journey

Starting my career at GoDaddy, I helped modernize observability and monitoring systems—cutting detection and resolution times significantly while laying the foundation for a culture of continuous improvement. At Moogsoft, I led the transformation of our platform with AI-powered incident management tools, fueling multi-million ARR growth and streamlining operations for enterprise clients. More recently, at Vultr, I spearheaded initiatives that integrated AI and machine learning into monitoring frameworks, optimizing cloud performance and reducing costs on a global scale.

## Philosophy & Vision

For me, observability is more than just system monitoring—it’s about marrying technical precision with empathetic leadership. I believe that equipping engineers with deep insights and the right tools is essential for unlocking their full potential. My guiding principle is simple: **“Do what you say you’re going to do, even when it’s inconvenient.”** This mindset has helped me mentor emerging leaders and drive projects that balance business objectives with operational excellence.

Looking forward, I’m excited to explore new frontiers in AI/ML integration, automation-first DevOps, and scalable cloud architectures—always with the goal of enhancing service availability and customer experience while nurturing the talent that makes it all possible.
