I’m an engineering executive with a proven track record in turning clever ideas into scalable, production-grade systems. My experience spans SRE, product management, and full-stack engineering, having led teams at GoDaddy, Moogsoft, and Vultr. I’ve built robust observability frameworks that drive actionable insights while also architecting and operating backend microservices using technologies like Quarkus. Notably, I led a critical migration from a legacy Java agent to a high-performance Rust-based solution, significantly enhancing performance and reducing system footprint. In essence, I combine hands-on technical expertise with strategic leadership to drive products from conception to large-scale operation.

## My Journey

Starting my career early career at IBM I learned the rigors of an FDA regulated helpdesk by working on the Azstrazeneca account for 2 years while completing my associates degree at an upstate New York community college. Leaving IBM I found my way to Arizona and joined GoDaddy, I helped modernize monitoring systems cutting detection and resolution times while establishing a culture of continuous improvement. After 12 years at GoDaddy I left to get outside my comfort zone at Moogsoft. I transformed our platform with AI-powered incident management tools that fueled multi-million ARR growth and streamlined operations for enterprise clients. More recently, at Vultr, I spearheaded initiatives that integrated advanced AI/ML techniques into both backend and observability systems, optimizing cloud performance and reducing costs on a global scale.

## Philosophy & Vision

For me, leadership means bridging the gap between high-level product strategy and hands-on technical execution. I believe the best outcomes are achieved by building engineering cultures centered around empowerment, measuring iterative change towards a clear goal, and by building inclusive and diverse teams. I'm data driven in my application of observability platforms, crafting efficient microservices, or mentoring teams to excel in fast-paced environments by focusing on impact and applying light weight processes. My guiding principle is simple: **“Do what you say you’re going to do, even when it’s inconvenient.”** which allows me to build trust within and amongst my teams.
