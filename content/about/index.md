I’m an engineering executive with a proven track record in turning visionary ideas into scalable, production-grade systems. My experience spans SRE, product management, and full-stack engineering—having led teams at GoDaddy, Moogsoft, and Vultr. I’ve built robust observability frameworks that drive actionable insights while also architecting and operating backend microservices using technologies like Quarkus. Notably, I led a critical migration from a legacy Java agent to a high-performance Rust-based solution, significantly enhancing performance and reducing system footprint. In essence, I combine hands-on technical expertise with strategic leadership to drive products from conception to large-scale operation.

## My Journey

Starting my career at GoDaddy, I helped modernize monitoring systems—cutting detection and resolution times while establishing a culture of continuous improvement. At Moogsoft, I transformed our platform with AI-powered incident management tools that fueled multi-million ARR growth and streamlined operations for enterprise clients. More recently, at Vultr, I spearheaded initiatives that integrated advanced AI/ML techniques into both backend and observability systems, optimizing cloud performance and reducing costs on a global scale.

## Philosophy & Vision

For me, leadership means bridging the gap between high-level product strategy and hands-on technical execution. I believe the best outcomes are achieved when innovation is supported by robust engineering—whether it's building next-generation observability platforms, crafting efficient microservices, or mentoring teams to excel in fast-paced environments. My guiding principle is simple: **“Do what you say you’re going to do, even when it’s inconvenient.”**
