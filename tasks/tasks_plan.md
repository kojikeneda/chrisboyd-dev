## Current Sprint Tasks

### Telemetry Fixes
1. ✅ Update telemetry.js with correct worker URL
2. ✅ Set proper cache headers for telemetry.js
3. ✅ Fix CORS configuration in the Worker
4. ✅ Deploy updated worker to Cloudflare
5. ✅ Test telemetry in production environment
6. ❌ Debug and fix any remaining connectivity issues

### Documentation
1. ✅ Set up project documentation structure
2. ✅ Document telemetry implementation
3. ❌ Create architecture diagrams
4. ❌ Document deployment workflow

## Known Issues

1. **Telemetry Connection Errors**
   - Symptoms: Console shows `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` for telemetry endpoint
   - Root Cause: Incorrect worker URL in telemetry.js
   - Status: Fixed, but still monitoring for issues

2. **Worker Deployment Issues**
   - Symptoms: Durable Objects migration errors
   - Root Cause: Previously deployed version using different structure
   - Status: Resolved with migrations file

3. **Cache-related Issues**
   - Symptoms: Old version of telemetry.js being served despite updates
   - Root Cause: Aggressive caching by Cloudflare or browsers
   - Status: Mitigated with cache control headers, monitoring for recurrence

## Next Steps

1. Complete telemetry testing and debugging
2. Finalize telemetry dashboard configuration in Dash0
3. Begin implementation of site improvements
4. Start content creation workflow
